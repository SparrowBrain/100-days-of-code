## TDD (AdventOfCode)
### Day 00: 2018-12-30, Sun

**Today's Progress**: Refactored some poorly written code to allow less granular testing, refactoring.

**Thoughts**: I've written some poor code, now it's difficult write something more functional. Today's progress felt slow.

### Day 01: 2018-12-31, Mon

**Today's Progress**: Finished refactoring Day04 tests/code.

**Thoughts**: The refactored code allows smaller methods, easier testing. The decision to consider the whole puzzle as a unit of work and the decision to inject same input into any part of the system is paying off, since it allows keeping the same input format for testing different components thus increasing work velocity, reliability.
